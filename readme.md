# Image Filling using a U-Net model 

In this project, I've have tried making use of a fused-encoder architecture with the [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) model for the task of Image Filling

This type of fusion model is inspired by [this project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hn9hGkW40AVWv1ZxCaF1Vl86n6d7OyVJ/view) by Ini Oguntola where they used this architecture type for image colorization task.
